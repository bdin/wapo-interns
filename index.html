		<!-- 	<div class="bio">I grew up in Washington and am, a little bittersweetly, a recent Duke graduate. I’ve thought I wanted to be a journalist for a long time — since the fifth grade, to be precise — so when I arrived at Duke, I immediately headed to the office of our school newspaper, The Chronicle, to check it out. I was hooked, and spent my four years as a reporter and editor at the paper. As an underclassman, I also interned at USA Today’s headquarters in McLean, was a correspondent with USA Today College and worked on a structured journalism start-up team in New York. Last summer, as an intern with CNN’s digital politics team, I wrote more than 30 articles and had the opportunity to do everything from contribute to coverage of the conventions to research Trump’s overseas real-estate holdings to create my own Trump mash-up video. I knew I wanted to keep following the presidential campaigns when, near the end of the summer, I dropped a weight on my toe trying to read a push notification with Trump’s latest tweet. So when I got back to school in the fall, I started interning with The Raleigh News & Observer, where I spent the year working on both the politics and metro desks. Because North Carolina’s status as a swing-state meant an unending stream of rallies, I had some really cool opportunities to help with campaign coverage — from interviewing Chelsea Clinton to reporting on Hillary Clinton’s eve of the election rally in Raleigh to covering election night from former Gov. Pat McCrory’s viewing party. I’ve also written about everything from urban beekeeping to hemp production to endangered strawberry crops — and really loved all of it. I couldn’t be more excited to keep learning and to keep doing the reporting that I love at the Post, which is the paper that inspired my love of journalism growing up and continues to do so today.</div> -->

As an undergraduate, I studied nematodes as a model for human disease at CU Boulder. Before that, I was raising sheep and wrangling cattle where the elevation dwarfs the population in Eastern Colorado.

I like doing science, but I prefer talking about doing science - preferably over beers. So I inundate my Facebook friends with sciencey quips, write blogs, make videos, and tweet about food and agricultural science. Science communication and outreach is a burgeoning field, but most adults still learn about science in the news. So I’m representing the American Society of Plant Biologists as a AAAS Mass Media Fellow to learn about the challenges journalists face in covering science stories.

After my internship, I’ll begin a quest for the perfect job: a little science doing, a little science teaching, a little science writing, and a whole lot of talking about science — preferably over beers.</div> -->

Getting to cover Yankees and Mets games, the PGA Championship, and the NBA Draft for the AP prepared me well for an event I was personally excited to cover &mdash; this year’s NCAA Men's Final Four. And while I enjoyed the daily process of covering ASU football and men's basketball in Arizona for the past four years, my true passion and goal is to write more human interest stories that delve deep into the lives of athletes to discover the person underneath the jersey. Outside of sports, I love going to concerts, finding new restaurants, watching Netflix (because who doesn't), and riding horses. Food recommendations always welcome.</div> -->

		<!-- 	<div class="bio">The oldest of three siblings, I grew up in Dallas. There, conversations on the news of the day fostered an early curiosity about current events, history, and American politics — from debates on open-carry legislation in Texas to side-of-the-road stops for historical markers. These family influences often extended beyond the home. In one instance, while on a family vacation, my dad paused to explain a memorial recognizing non-Jews who rescued Jews during the Holocaust, inspiring what would become a written collection of profiles honoring 36 of these Righteous Gentiles. A love for writing had actually caught on a few years earlier when I founded my sixth-grade newspaper, which included photocopying the issues myself. Summer internships at the Dallas Morning News earned me my first bylines, before coming to college where I spent four years reporting and editing for the Yale Daily News. My various YDN beats involved coverage of the Yale administration, but one story took me half way around the world to Singapore to report on gay rights activism at Yale’s affiliated campus there. Other internships at The Marshall Project and The New England Center for Investigative Reporting shaped a particular interest in coverage of the American criminal justice system. I hope to one day trace the effects of wrongful convictions on exonerated men and women, and chronicle the stories of communities affected by violent crime, mass incarceration, and poverty. In addition to my reporting interests, I am a lentil enthusiast and a lover of all-things ginger-flavored. Along with every member of my immediate family, I know the complete dialogue from “The Pink Panther” (the Steve Martin version), yet I’m the only one who can claim a similar mastery of most “West Wing” episodes.</div> -->

Growing up in Austin, I began to love sports and would play whatever sport was in season. I always liked to talk about sports and debate about sports topics, but I never considered sports journalism as a career. I always thought I was going to be a basketball coach. Then one day my freshman year of college, my dad asked me why I don't become a sports journalist since I was always watching ESPN and reading sports stories. From that day on, I began learning more and more about journalism and started to love it. I worked at the student newspaper at UT &mdash; The Daily Texan &mdash; then I interned at the Austin American-Statesman and the Tampa Bay Times. I really love doing narrative and long-form journalism and hope to have a career where I can write those type of stories. When I'm away from a keyboard and a notepad, I'm probably on a basketball court playing pick-up basketball, or I'm outside going for a walk, a run or a hike. I'm fluent in Spanish; I consider "Superman: The Movie" one of the greatest movies of all time; and when I was a sophomore in high school I said I had gone to school in another continent, and when the class asked where, I said Mexico.</div> -->

I spent a summer at the LA Times Data Desk working mostly with campaign finance data, then started a team at the Daily Cal to work on interactive graphics, data stories and news apps. Then, I took a break from journalism to study social theory at Cambridge University, essentially spending my entire time there in a single library.

As an intern for a small weekly newspaper, I was just starting to get a feel for my future as a photojournalist.

It’s an opportunity I dreamed about attaining, one that once seemed as obscure as finding a needle in a haystack. However, with my ample experience in the haystack realm as a Nebraska native, I feel fortunate to have landed this position.

I had a hodgepodge of roles at The Daily Californian: copy editor, night editor, higher education reporter, assistant news editor and, finally, “cool” managing editor, though that nickname never really caught on. In my final months at the Daily Cal, I spearheaded coverage of free speech-related protests that made national news. I was also a copy-editing intern at Gannett and The San Francisco Chronicle. You’ll have to forgive me if I can’t resist the urge to correct your grammar — I bite, but I mean well.

When I’m not laughing at the puns in my own headlines or drowning in hot tea, I enjoy tagging the same friend in every meme on Facebook, buying tons of books destined to languish on a shelf and hunting for the perfect shade of lipstick. I look forward to learning The Post’s digital ropes as a multiplatform producer this summer.</div> -->

			I grew up in Washington and am, a little bittersweetly, a recent Duke graduate. I’ve thought I wanted to be a journalist for a long time — since the fifth grade, to be precise — so when I arrived at Duke, I immediately headed to the office of our school newspaper, The Chronicle, to check it out. I was hooked, and spent my four years as a reporter and editor at the paper. As an underclassman, I also interned at USA Today’s headquarters in McLean, was a correspondent with USA Today College and worked on a structured journalism start-up team in New York. Last summer, as an intern with CNN’s digital politics team, I wrote more than 30 articles and had the opportunity to do everything from contribute to coverage of the conventions to research Trump’s overseas real-estate holdings to create my own Trump mash-up video. I knew I wanted to keep following the presidential campaigns when, near the end of the summer, I dropped a weight on my toe trying to read a push notification with Trump’s latest tweet. So when I got back to school in the fall, I started interning with The Raleigh News & Observer, where I spent the year working on both the politics and metro desks. Because North Carolina’s status as a swing-state meant an unending stream of rallies, I had some really cool opportunities to help with campaign coverage — from interviewing Chelsea Clinton to reporting on Hillary Clinton’s eve of the election rally in Raleigh to covering election night from former Gov. Pat McCrory’s viewing party. I’ve also written about everything from urban beekeeping to hemp production to endangered strawberry crops — and really loved all of it. I couldn’t be more excited to keep learning and to keep doing the reporting that I love at the Post, which is the paper that inspired my love of journalism growing up and continues to do so today.

			I’m a senior studying physics and economics at Berkeley, where I currently live in an old hotel that’s been converted in a student housing cooperative. Every Friday, I attempt to cook dinner for the 150 people who live here, and most of the time, the result is affectionately referred to as “co-op slop.” I’m marginally more experienced as a reporter — I covered higher education for a few semesters at our campus paper, the Daily Californian, and since I go to Berkeley, that means my first story was an all-night student protest and that I was tear-gassed a couple months later. I spent a summer at the LA Times Data Desk working mostly with campaign finance data, then started a team at the Daily Cal to work on interactive graphics, data stories and news apps. Then, I took a break from journalism to study social theory at Cambridge University, essentially spending my entire time there in a single library. I’m hoping to bring my interests in education and political data to the Post, develop some new areas of knowledge (baseball?) and learn how to get FOIA officers to respond to me. I’d love to talk about PDFs, photography or quantum field theory, and I’m originally from San Diego, so my least favorite word is “Tex-Mex.”

			I'm a junior at Northwestern University, studying journalism with a minor in Asian-American studies. I grew up in the Bay Area and moved to southern California for high school, before I headed to the snowy Midwest for school, where I quickly learned that any winter apparel I thought I had was not truly winter apparel. At Northwestern, I'm involved with The Daily Northwestern and the Knight Lab, and I've had the opportunity to investigate a potentially wrongful conviction and do political reporting here in D.C. Last summer, I moved back to my old stomping grounds for a stint on the interactive team at The San Francisco Chronicle, and this spring, I was a reporting intern in South Africa, where I had to run from police firing rubber bullets at a protest in my first week. I don't really know what I want to do in the future, but I'm hoping this summer will be a step in the right direction. If you're ever in the mood for story time in the newsroom, swing by and I'll tell you about the time I was accidentally kidnapped.</p><p>Fun fact: Ashley Wu from last year's intern class drew the shark that's about to bite my head off!

			Hello East Coast! I come to D.C. by way of California where I graduated from UC Davis with a PhD in Plant Biotechnology in June 2017. As an undergraduate, I studied nematodes as a model for human disease at CU Boulder. Before that, I was raising sheep and wrangling cattle where the elevation dwarfs the population in Eastern Colorado.</p><p>I like doing science, but I prefer talking about doing science - preferably over beers. So I inundate my Facebook friends with sciencey quips, write blogs, make videos, and tweet about food and agricultural science. Science communication and outreach is a burgeoning field, but most adults still learn about science in the news. So I’m representing the American Society of Plant Biologists as a AAAS Mass Media Fellow to learn about the challenges journalists face in covering science stories.</p><p>After my internship, I’ll begin a quest for the perfect job: a little science doing, a little science teaching, a little science writing, and a whole lot of talking about science — preferably over beers.

			I was born and raised in Kabul. I have a degree in Business from Kabul University and 3½ years of reporting and translating experience with the Washington Post’s Kabul bureau. My goal is to become a foreign correspondent for an American paper in the next 2 years. I am hoping the summer internship helps me achieve that goal. Working with one of the most prestigious paper as a reporter in a war zone is demanding and sometimes challenging, I overcame all those challenges, thanks to Kevin, Sudarsan and many more Post reporters I have worked with. I have done many silly things in my life but the silliest was sharing a room with our driver in a reporting trip with Pamela Constable in Jalalabad – I could have had my own room. I couldn’t sleep whole night because the driver snored like a chopper.

			I was born and raised in Hong Kong, where the mishmash of urban and tropical jungle has over the years made me both a city and nature enthusiast. At Princeton, I led the University Press Club, a group of student freelance journalists; ran cross country and track (though I got roundly dusted all four years); and held the illustrious title of grocery shopper for my food cooperative. I love all things outdoors (trail running and hiking in particular) and indoors (throwing together hearty home-cooked meals), and journalism is a good excuse to indulge in both those passions.

			Two summers ago I was navigating my way through a manure-laden farm with my camera dangling for dear life around my neck, swaying to and fro above a mess a few lens cleaners couldn’t fix. I was herding some pigs around an empty barn, working on my first photo story in a rural town in northeastern Nebraska. As an intern for a small weekly newspaper, I was just starting to get a feel for my future as a photojournalist. With this picturesque scene forever ingrained in my mind as chapter one of my career, it seems surreal to be moving to D.C. in just a few weeks to work for the Washington Post. It’s an opportunity I dreamed about attaining, one that once seemed as obscure as finding a needle in a haystack. However, with my ample experience in the haystack realm as a Nebraska native, I feel fortunate to have landed this position. I’m looking forward to dedicating my summer to shooting and meeting the talented people who make the WaPo such an outstanding publication. I’m hoping to learn a thing or two along the way, as well. To share a few brief things about me: I’m 20, I never turn down a karaoke night, I can’t open my eyes underwater and if you have a dog that needs to be walked, I’m your girl. See you in June!

			Hello, everyone! Excited to be spending the summer with y'all in the newsroom. I just graduated this March and have been traveling around the world since then, exploring a total of seven countries. One of my favorite places was Iceland, which was amazing for an outdoors and "Game of Thrones" geek like me (one of my biggest fan girl moments was meeting George R.R. Marin backstage, but that's another story).

			I am a rising senior at Brown University concentrating in Public Policy and Economics. I’m an unabashed policy wonk and news geek from Singapore and India. At Brown, I write and edit for the Brown Political Review, work with Amnesty International USA and have just emerged from a year-long study of climate change in print media. But my real education takes place after hours, when I walk through the doors of the Brown Daily Herald and edit its opinions page (and self-indulgently publish my own columns too). After I graduate, I hope to continue my journey with journalism and someday return to Singapore to cover South and East Asian politics. But for now, D.C. is exactly where I want to be — I can’t imagine a more important time or place for reporting, synthesizing and publishing news. I’m looking forward to 10 weeks of writing, learning and working with some of my personal heroes this summer!

			During my time in Washington, D.C., my goal is to spend as much time as possible with the giant pandas at the National Zoo. And to kill it as the Post’s summer photo editing intern. Visually driven, I focus much of my time on making and looking at photos. I have experience working as a staff photographer and photo editor at the Columbia Missourian and look forward to learning everything I can during this internship. Before going to school at the University of Missouri, I grew up in Springfield, Missouri. I am a lover of all things animals and enjoy caring for too many houseplants, meeting new people and exploring new places. I look forward to meeting and working with everyone at the Washington Post and I’m excited for a wonderful summer!

			Howdy, I'm Emma. I'm a 2017 graduate of Ohio University's E.W. Scripps School of Journalism and I'll be interning on The Post's national desk. I'm one of those dorky college-newspaper types, and perhaps too proud of it. I'm also from the Detroit area and enjoy punk music, hockey and hot dogs.  For fun, I like to read about medical mysteries and anxiety-inducing advancements in biotechnology. For more fun, I just like to read. I hope to one day report on medicine and public policy, but I'm eternally grateful for any opportunity to pick up the phone and get to work. I'm so excited to meet everyone!

			Growing up in Seattle, my passion for writing about sports all started with a tiny blog in junior high that ultimately led me all the way to covering collegiate and professional sports throughout my college career at ASU. While interning for the Associated Press in New York City last summer, my love of sports, writing, big cities, and food collided into one truly amazing experience. Getting to cover Yankees and Mets games, the PGA Championship, and the NBA Draft for the AP prepared me well for an event I was personally excited to cover &mdash; this year’s NCAA Men's Final Four. And while I enjoyed the daily process of covering ASU football and men's basketball in Arizona for the past four years, my true passion and goal is to write more human interest stories that delve deep into the lives of athletes to discover the person underneath the jersey. Outside of sports, I love going to concerts, finding new restaurants, watching Netflix (because who doesn't), and riding horses. Food recommendations always welcome.

			My name’s Andrea, and I graduated from UC Berkeley in December. That’s what my diploma will tell you, anyway. I spent most of my four years there cooped up in a cluttered newspaper office atop a hill, often forgetting there was class to attend.</p><p>I had a hodgepodge of roles at The Daily Californian: copy editor, night editor, higher education reporter, assistant news editor and, finally, “cool” managing editor, though that nickname never really caught on. In my final months at the Daily Cal, I spearheaded coverage of free speech-related protests that made national news. I was also a copy-editing intern at Gannett and The San Francisco Chronicle. You’ll have to forgive me if I can’t resist the urge to correct your grammar — I bite, but I mean well.</p><p>When I’m not laughing at the puns in my own headlines or drowning in hot tea, I enjoy tagging the same friend in every meme on Facebook, buying tons of books destined to languish on a shelf and hunting for the perfect shade of lipstick. I look forward to learning The Post’s digital ropes as a multiplatform producer this summer.

			Sintia Radu is in love with unicorns and everything that might seem unlikely to be achieved. She is an award-winning magazine writer in her home country of Romania and came to the U.S. on a Fulbright scholarship to expand her understanding of storytelling. She speaks six languages and worked for International Emmy-nominated television programs, radio shows, magazines, and in digital media. Most recently, she covered business and technology for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, and served as managing editor for Esquire magazine in Bucharest. When she’s not chasing stories of mighty entrepreneurs digging for ideas in their parents’ basement (I know, the cliché), she's hosting events, speaking at TEDx, and working on innovative tools that would make the media industry better and more efficient in this crazy fast-paced world. One project that she started at the Missouri School of Journalism, an iOS interviewing tool for journalists, got her a spot in the 2016 WiSTEM (Women in STEM) cohort in Chicago’s 1871 technology incubator, an invitation to present the product to Apple executives in Cupertino, and an interview in the 2017 AP’s report on innovation in the media industry. P.S. She laughs at her own jokes. Just give her time.

I'm a first-generation American who's figuring it out as I go, originally from the Chicago suburbs and now a proud Boston resident. I lost a year of sleep editing for my college newspaper and then spent another year writing for the same paper as the famed Spotlight team, but I covered paintings and pastry chefs instead. I hope to continue on the arts and culture reporting path, and to one day have an IMDbPro account.

			Hi there! I’m Paola, and I will be one of the multiplatform desk interns for this summer. I have worked as a copy editor at The Daily Pennsylvanian, working up to become the head of the department my sophomore year. After my term, I joined the design department, where many of my pun-tastic ideas were shot down. This past summer I returned to my home state of California to work at the Los Angeles Times as a multiplatform intern.</p><p>Beyond my insatiable need to correct everyone’s grammar whenever possible, I’m hungry to find the next best food place and get the perfect Insta. To hopefully counteract the amount of food I inhale, I also like to exercise, from HIIT to running to kickboxing. I’m also a media junkie, whether it’s reading the news, listening to pop punk or the Hamilton soundtrack on repeat or keeping up with the millions of TV shows I watch. I’m excited to be in D.C. this summer and look forward to working with you all!

			The oldest of three siblings, I grew up in Dallas. There, conversations on the news of the day fostered an early curiosity about current events, history, and American politics — from debates on open-carry legislation in Texas to side-of-the-road stops for historical markers. These family influences often extended beyond the home. In one instance, while on a family vacation, my dad paused to explain a memorial recognizing non-Jews who rescued Jews during the Holocaust, inspiring what would become a written collection of profiles honoring 36 of these Righteous Gentiles. A love for writing had actually caught on a few years earlier when I founded my sixth-grade newspaper, which included photocopying the issues myself. Summer internships at the Dallas Morning News earned me my first bylines, before coming to college where I spent four years reporting and editing for the Yale Daily News. My various YDN beats involved coverage of the Yale administration, but one story took me half way around the world to Singapore to report on gay rights activism at Yale’s affiliated campus there. Other internships at The Marshall Project and The New England Center for Investigative Reporting shaped a particular interest in coverage of the American criminal justice system. I hope to one day trace the effects of wrongful convictions on exonerated men and women, and chronicle the stories of communities affected by violent crime, mass incarceration, and poverty. In addition to my reporting interests, I am a lentil enthusiast and a lover of all-things ginger-flavored. Along with every member of my immediate family, I know the complete dialogue from “The Pink Panther” (the Steve Martin version), yet I’m the only one who can claim a similar mastery of most “West Wing” episodes.

			I was born in Austin, Texas, but two months later my parents and I moved to Mexico City. We lived there for four years before we moved back to Austin. Growing up in Austin, I began to love sports and would play whatever sport was in season. I always liked to talk about sports and debate about sports topics, but I never considered sports journalism as a career. I always thought I was going to be a basketball coach. Then one day my freshman year of college, my dad asked me why I don't become a sports journalist since I was always watching ESPN and reading sports stories. From that day on, I began learning more and more about journalism and started to love it. I worked at the student newspaper at UT &mdash; The Daily Texan &mdash; then I interned at the Austin American-Statesman and the Tampa Bay Times. I really love doing narrative and long-form journalism and hope to have a career where I can write those type of stories. When I'm away from a keyboard and a notepad, I'm probably on a basketball court playing pick-up basketball, or I'm outside going for a walk, a run or a hike. I'm fluent in Spanish; I consider "Superman: The Movie" one of the greatest movies of all time; and when I was a sophomore in high school I said I had gone to school in another continent, and when the class asked where, I said Mexico.

Looking back now, this somehow inspired me to be a journalist and I did find my passion for storytelling along the way. With a dream to become a multimedia journalist, I work to tell stories in creative ways, whether through writing, video, coding, or immersive media. My current goal is to become a certified drone pilot so that I can make videos using drones.</p><p>Growing up in Guangdong, China has provided me with global awareness and an understanding of different cultures. This has also made me the biggest fan of Asian food. I'm looking forward to exploring some good restaurants this summer.
