Under my leadership, The Daily Illini won best newspaper and best website in the state at the Illinois College Press Association awards. This was pretty cool but the best part of my college paper was that it became my home away from home and I met all of my best friends there. I\u2019ve also had internships at The New York Times and Chicago Sun-Times and can\u2019t wait to copy edit at the Washington Post this summer! In my free time, I love traveling when possible.
